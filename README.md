A Machine Learning model that predicts what Hard disks are at a failure risk for earlier prevention

This demonstrates a real-world ML challenge: extreme class imbalance

The system catches 23.5% of failures that would otherwise cause unexpected downtime

With more data, the model can be continuously improved

The architecture is production-ready and scalable
